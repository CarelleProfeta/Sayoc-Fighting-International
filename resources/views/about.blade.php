            <h5>Pioneer of Filipino Martial Arts in United States America</h5>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">After his time in the merchant marines in 1962, he came to the United States, settling in Queens, New York, where he opened his first martial arts school teaching Judo and Ju Jitsu six years later. He introduced martial arts to his kids at a very young age, and by the time his eldest children were in their teens, they were already assisting the Grand Master in running the school. In the early 80’s, Grand Master Bo quietly moved his family to Southwest Florida and worked as a corrections officer until his retirement in the early nineties. Over the years, Grand Master Sayoc became highly ranked in more than half a dozen martial arts, both as a student and instructor, which includes Judo, Ju Jitsu, Tae Kwondo, Karate, and the Filipino arts of Arnis de Mano, Eskrima and Kali. Kali is the art taken to a new height by Grand Master Sayoc. Sayoc Kali is a Filipino Martial Art passed down through his family for several generations.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">Being the recipient of numerous awards, five of which came from the Hall of Fame, he imparted his broad knowledge in martial arts by speaking in seminars and being a member of various organizations. Following 30 long years of research, study, experimentation and teaching, he introduced a new approach to close quarter fighting: the “Finger Touch.” After years of extensive propagation of the Filipino Martial Arts in the United States, Grandmaster Bo returned to the Philippines.</p>
